Google Sidebar
==============

Description
-----------

Google Sidebar is a GreaseMonkey user script for Firefox. It enriches your
Google searches with results from a host of web services. Currently the
following services are supported:

  * Flickr
  * Dictionary.com
  * YouTube
  * Wikipedia
  * SlideShare
  * Twitter
  * Scribd
  * Digg
  
You can configure which services will be used.

The initial version of this user script was sponsored by Ataxo Interactive. In
the future I hope to also support chrome, but that seems to be blocked by
`issue 18857 <http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=18857>`_ for
the time being - any help is appreciated.

Install
-------

Install GreaseMonkey extension into Firefox and click google_sidebar.user.js.
